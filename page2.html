	    <h3>A Brief History</h3>
      <p>Wheel gymnastics is a form of gymnastics that originated in Germany.</p>
      <p>The wheel was invented in 1925 by Otto Feick in Sch√∂nau an der Brend. The grandson of a blacksmith, Feick was inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood in Reichenbach, when he had tied sticks between two hoops that his grandfather had made and rolled down a hill.</p>
      <h3>Wheel in the United States</h3>
      <p>In the US, wheel gymnastics is very obscure. The only notable wheel gymnastics gyms are in Chicago, IL and Madison, WI. The US national team has only ever earned 2 medals, both in vault. The most prominent gym wheel club is located in Chicago, IL and has recently performed at events such as the Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Von Steuben Parade, and the 2024 US Gymnastics Olympic trials.</p>

      <p>These are some videos of my past routines. The first one is my vault from the 2023 Team Cup, the second is my 2022 World Championships spiral routine, and the last is my straightline from the 2020 US National Championships.</p>
